DBMS or database management system is a software or technology used to manage data form a database.
Some examples are:
MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, etc.

advantages:
Data Sharing: Data from the same database can be shared by multiple users at the same time.

Integrity: It allows chaging the data stored in an organized and refined manner.

Data Independence: It allows changing the data structure without changing the composition of executing programs.

Data Security: DBMS comes with the tools to make the storage and transfer of databases secure and reliable. Authentication and encryption are the tools used in DBMS for data security.

There are multiple languages used in DBMS such as: 
# DDL (Data Definition Language)
# DML (Data Manipulation Language)
# DCL (Data Control Language)
# TCL (Transaction Control Language)

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language that differs from others in that it can only be used for a specific application, which is relational database management systems. 
It was first introduced in the 1970s, offering advantages ober the older read-write APIs. Introduced the concept of accessing many records in a single command. And removed the abstraction of the index for particular registries.
Although a standard exists, none of the current implementations adhere to it and modifies the base language

Relational Model

Represents how data is stored in a relational database. A relational Database consists of a collection of tables, each of which is assigned a unique name.
