### <font color="#00b050">Introduction</font>
Time series analysis (TSA), is a statistical technique that focuses on analyzing time-oriented data points, typically to ==understand the underlying patterns, forecast future values and make decisions based on time-dependent data.== Time series data is characterized by observations collected sequentially over time, often at regular intervals, such as daily stock prices, monthly sales figures or annual GDP growth rates.
##### <font color="#00b050">Types of data that time series analysis focuses on</font>
TSA data can be Univariate or Multivariate. 
Data is ==univariate== when it consists of a single variable recorded over time. For example:
- The daily price of a stock
- The wage of employees in an industry
- The length of shoes over the years.
The data is multivariate when multiple variables are observed over time. For example:
- The daily price of several stocks
- How many hours a day a person spends on Instagram vs Their self-esteem score
