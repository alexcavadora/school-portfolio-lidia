ejercicio: definir base de datos

A database is a collection of data, stored in a logical and structured manner.

It is stored in such a way that makes accesing the information easier. 
There are 4 basic operations:
Reading(viewing), insterting, updating and deleting data.

While there are platforms for developing databases, by definition it could just be an excel spreadsheet, and even written on paper.

There are several types of databases, including:

- Relational database
- Non-relational database
- Distributed database
- Object-oriented database
- Cloud database
- Centralized database
- Open-source database
- Data warehouse

However, there are great benefits to using a DBMS (Database management system):

Setup user accounts and roles, apply permissions to database objects (determine which user is allowed to access which data)

Remote access, importing and exporting data for backups, creating log files, and much more.

Data persistence vs ephimeral storage

can be stored permanently or in-memory for temporal storage


General uses can be:
charity for registering clients helped and donation information

Family management: to keep track of birthdays, bills and expenses, collections of movies, comics, etc.

When you buy something and the clerk asks for your phone number or adress, in order to send you special offers, discounts.

Clothing store invertory, employee accounting information. 

A database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database. It can determine in which manner data can be stored, organized and manipulated.


- Hierarchical database model:
	This is the oldest form of database model. It was developed by IBM or IMS, and is a set of organized data in tree structure. DB record is a tree consisting of many groups called segments. It uses one-to-many relationships, and data access is predictable.
In systems analysis, a one-to-many relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities (see also entityâ€“relationship model) A and B in which an element of A may be linked to many elements of B, but a member of B is linked to only one element of A. For instance, think of A as books, and B as pages. A book can have many pages, but a page can only be in one book.

-Network model: a flexivble model in which the structure is not limited to a hierarchy or lattice.

-Relational model: is an approach to managing data using a structure and language consisten with first-order- predicate logic
